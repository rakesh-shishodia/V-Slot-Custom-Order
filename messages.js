    short: "Billing is rounded up to the nearest 500 mm; any off-cut over 100 mm is shipped to you.",
    example: "<strong>Example</strong> – You order 2 pcs of 1000 mm and 1 pc of 1200 mm (total 3200 mm), so we bill for 3500 mm. You’ll receive your 2 pcs of 1000 mm, 1 pc of 1200 mm plus a 300 mm off-cut.",

    <strong>Material & Waste Policy</strong><br><br>
    We cut orders in 500 mm increments to reduce material wastage, keep our prices low and our operations efficient, and <strong>those savings go straight into your final per-metre rate</strong>.<br><br>
    <strong>How it works:</strong><br><br>

    1. <strong>Rounding</strong>: Every order is rounded up to the next 500 mm increment and accordingly billed for.<br>
    2. <strong>Clean-offs</strong>: Rather than discard leftovers, we ship you any piece longer than 100 mm.<br><br>
    <strong>Real-world example:</strong><br><br>
    • You specify: 2 pcs of 1000 mm and 1 pc of 1200 mm (total 3200 mm).<br>
    • We round up and bill 3500 mm at your per-metre rate.<br>
    • You receive 2 pcs of 1000 mm and 1 pc of 1200 mm plus a 300 mm off-cut which you can use for jigs, fixtures, or future tweaks.<br><br>
    This policy keeps our material costs predictable and our prices competitive — while ensuring you never pay for wasted material.
